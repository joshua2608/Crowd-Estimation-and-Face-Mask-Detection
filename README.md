During this pandemic WHO has made it compulsory to wear masks, to maintain social distancing and to avoid social gathering. But there are people out there who consider it as hoax
and refuse to wear mask, and follow the COVID-19 protocols. It is not an easy job for the
security officials to keep a check on everybody in a crowd for masks and to get a count of
the crowd. To make things easier we came up with a simple solution to identify if a person
is wearing a mask or not and also counts the number of people in a crowd. In our study we
develop a program using deep learning to count and detect the masked faces.
To detect a face mask, we are going to implement it in 2 steps:-
1. Training the model
2. Deploying the trained model
We use MobileNetV2 network to train the model OpenCV to implement face detection module.

The Face Mask Detector and the Crowd Estimator identifies and also gives a count of those
people who are wearing a mask and those who are not wearing a mask. In a crowd it might
be difficult to perform such task and amidst Covid-19 it is not safe to be in a crowd, so to
keep a check on the people in a crowd this program can be helpful
